The project provides a basic set of image processing components that can be
used with pypes. The components all use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to
these capabilities.

To build a component, ensure you have PIL installed and then simply run the
provided setup.py script provided with each component:

python setup.py bdist_egg

This will create an egg file under dist/ in your working directory. This egg
can then be added to pypes by copying/moving it to the $PYPES/plugins where
$PYPES is the parent folder containing the pypes application.

If you haven't installed pypes, then please go to:

and download the latest release.
